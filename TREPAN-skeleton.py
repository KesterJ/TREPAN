###Making M OF N tests
def make_candidate_tests(features, samples):
    """
    A function that should take all features, all samples, and return a test
    for each feature.
    HOW TO DETERMINE THE THRESHOLD?
    """
    
def make_mofn_tests(besttest, C, samples):
    """
    Finds the best m-of-n test, using a beam width of 2.
    
    NOTES:
    -NEEDS TO KNOW HOW TO COLLAPSE TESTS WHEN TWO REDUNDANT THINGS ARE
    PRESENT e.g. 2-of {y, z, x, Â¬x} -> 1-of {y, z}
    -NEEDS TO KNOW WHICH TESTS WERE ALREADY USED ON THIS BRANCH, AND NOT USE
    THOSE FEATURES AGAIN
    -NEEDS TO AVOID USING TWO TESTS ON THE SAME LITERAL e.g. x > 0.5 and x > 0.7
    -NEEDS TO TEST USING BOTH x and Â¬x AS THE SEED FOR BEAM SEARCH
